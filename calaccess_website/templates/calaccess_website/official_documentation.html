<h3>ZIP Export ReadMe</h3>

<p><b>Updated on 09/27/2010</b></p>

<p>Includes an (incomplete) list of data files found inside dbexport.zip. Note also how the format of the data files is wrong (should be .TSV, not .CSV).</p>

<h3>CAL-ACCESS Tables, Columns and Indexes</h3>

<p><b>Updated on 04/18/2002 (or 2/21/2000?)</b></p>

<p>The closest thing we have to a comprehensive record layout for CAL-ACCESS. Includes a list of tables as well as column and index lists for each table.</p>

<p>Apparently, this document was produced through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerDesigner">PowerDesigner</a>, an enterprise modeling and metadata management tool developed by SyBase, a subsidary of SAP since 2010.</p>

<p>This is a good starting point for researching specific tables and fields. Beware, though. Since this is one of the older available documents, some of its content is outdated.</p>

<h3>Map from .CAL Format to Database Table and Fields</h3>

<p><b>Updated on 04/25/2002</b></p>

<p>Includes a mapping of .CAL file format fields to the CAL-ACCESS database fields. According to the .CAL ReadMe document, the field names in the CAL-ACCESS raw data export are from the tables, rather than the .CAL format.</p>

<h2>.CAL file format</h2>

<p>Much of what ends up in CAL-ACCESS is submitted in an electronic file format known as .CAL, which is specifically designed to interface with CAL-ACCESS. These .CAL specifications, along with the required campaign and lobbyist disclosure forms, are also helpful in understanding the lifecycle of information flowing into CAL-ACCESS.</p>

<p>.CAL is a non-proprietary electronic file format used by third-party software vendors to submit electronic disclosure filings on behalf of their clients, California campaigns and lobbyists.</p>

<p>This file format was "the basis for the design of the CAL-ACCESS system", according to the documentation provided by the Political Reform Divison of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The following documents can also be found in the CalFormat directory inside either the CAL-ACCESS documentation and database export ZIP files.</p>

<h2>.CAL Format Readme</h2>

<p><b>Updated on 04/25/2002</b><p>

<p>A brief explanation of the purpose of the .CAL format and its relationship to the CAL-ACCESS system.</p>
